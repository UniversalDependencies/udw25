# Universal Dependencies Workshop 2025 (UDW 2025)

### [SyntaxFest 2025](https://syntaxfest.github.io/), Ljubljana, August 26–29

UDW 2025 will be held at the SyntaxFest in Ljubljana,
during the week of August 26–29, 2025. 

[Universal Dependencies](http://universaldependencies.org/) (UD) is a
framework for cross-linguistically consistent treebank annotation that
has so far been applied to over 100 languages.

The framework is aiming to capture similarities as well as
idiosyncrasies among typologically different languages (e.g.,
morphologically rich languages, pro-drop languages, and languages
featuring clitic doubling). The goal in developing UD was not only to
support comparative evaluation and cross-lingual learning but also to
facilitate multilingual natural language processing and enable
comparative linguistic studies.
