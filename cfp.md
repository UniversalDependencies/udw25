# CALL FOR PAPERS

**The eighth workshop on Universal Dependencies**  
_Part of [SyntaxFest 2025](https://syntaxfest.github.io/syntaxfest25/), Ljubljana, August 26-29_

[Universal Dependencies](https://universaldependencies.org) (UD)
is a framework for cross-linguistically consistent treebank annotation
that has so far been applied to over 150 languages . The framework is
aiming to capture similarities as well as idiosyncrasies among
typologically different languages (e.g., morphologically rich
languages, pro-drop languages, and languages featuring clitic
doubling). The goal in developing UD was not only to support
comparative evaluation and cross-lingual learning but also to
facilitate multilingual natural language processing and enable
comparative linguistic studies.

The Universal Dependencies Workshop series was started to create a
forum for discussion of the theory and practice of UD, its use in
research and development, and its future goals and challenges. Some of
the previous workshops have been co-located with Coling, EMNLP, and
SyntaxFest. We invite papers on all topics relevant to UD, including
but not limited to:

- Theoretical foundations and universal guidelines
- Linguistic analysis of specific languages and/or constructions
- Language typology and linguistic universals
- Treebank annotation, conversion and validation
- Word segmentation, morphological tagging and syntactic parsing
- The use of the UD data for evaluating or understanding language models
- Linguistic studies based on the UD data

Priority will be given to papers that adopt a cross-lingual perspective.

## SyntaxFest 2025

[SyntaxFest](https://syntaxfest.github.io/) is a biennial event that
brings together a series of events focusing on topics such as
empirical syntax, linguistic annotation, statistical language
analysis, and natural language processing. Apart from the 8th UDW, it
hosts [TLT](https://www.korpuslab.uni-hamburg.de/en/tlt2025.html),
DepLing, IWPT, and [Quasy](https://quansyntax.github.io/quasy2025/index.html).
Each workshop publishes its own proceedings, but all events follow
a shared submission process, timeline, and programme.
[The UniDive 1st Shared Task on Morphosyntactic Parsing](https://unidive.lisn.upsaclay.fr/doku.php?id=other-events:msp) takes place on Aug, 26.
