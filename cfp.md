# CALL FOR PAPERS

**The eighth workshop on Universal Dependencies**  
_Part of [SyntaxFest 2025](https://syntaxfest.github.io/syntaxfest25/), Ljubljana, August 26-29_

[Universal Dependencies](https://universaldependencies.org) (UD)
is a framework for cross-linguistically consistent treebank annotation
that has so far been applied to over 150 languages . The framework is
aiming to capture similarities as well as idiosyncrasies among
typologically different languages (e.g., morphologically rich
languages, pro-drop languages, and languages featuring clitic
doubling). The goal in developing UD was not only to support
comparative evaluation and cross-lingual learning but also to
facilitate multilingual natural language processing and enable
comparative linguistic studies.

The Universal Dependencies Workshop series was started to create a
forum for discussion of the theory and practice of UD, its use in
research and development, and its future goals and challenges. Some of
the previous workshops have been co-located with Coling, EMNLP, and
SyntaxFest. We invite papers on all topics relevant to UD, including
but not limited to:

- Theoretical foundations and universal guidelines
- Linguistic analysis of specific languages and/or constructions
- Language typology and linguistic universals
- Treebank annotation, conversion and validation
- Word segmentation, morphological tagging and syntactic parsing
- The use of the UD data for evaluating or understanding language models
- Linguistic studies based on the UD data

Priority will be given to papers that adopt a cross-lingual perspective.


## SyntaxFest 2025

[SyntaxFest](https://syntaxfest.github.io/) is a biennial event that
brings together a series of events focusing on topics such as
empirical syntax, linguistic annotation, statistical language
analysis, and natural language processing. Apart from the 8th UDW, it
hosts [TLT](https://www.korpuslab.uni-hamburg.de/en/tlt2025.html),
DepLing, IWPT, and [Quasy](https://quansyntax.github.io/quasy2025/index.html).
Each workshop publishes its own proceedings, but all events follow
a shared submission process, timeline, and programme.
[The UniDive 1st Shared Task on Morphosyntactic Parsing](https://unidive.lisn.upsaclay.fr/doku.php?id=other-events:msp) takes place on Aug, 26.

## Important Dates

- Paper submission Deadline: April 15, 2025
- Notification of acceptance: June 2, 2025
- Camera-ready version due June 16, 2025
- Conference dates  August 26-29, 2025

## Submission Information

### Submission formats

We invite submissions in two formats: 

- Regulars (long) papers up to 8 pages of content
  (excluding references and appendices). Regular papers should present
  substantial, original, and unpublished research, including empirical
  evaluation results where appropriate.
- Short papers up to 4 pages of content (excluding references and
  appendices).  Short papers may offer smaller, focused contributions,
  such as work in progress, negative results, surveys, or opinion
  pieces.

Accepted papers will be given an additional page to address reviewer
comments. 


### Paper submission

Papers must be submitted digitally in PDF format via the online
conference system: <https://openreview.net/group?id=SyntaxFest/2025>.
When submitting, authors will be asked to indicate which workshops
they wish their paper to be considered for and to specify whether
their submission is archival or non-archival.

Please note that setting up an OpenReview account for the first time
can take some time. To avoid last-minute issues, we strongly recommend
registering an account in advance.

### Submission templates

All submissions should follow the two-column ACL style guidelines. We
strongly recommend the use of the LaTeX style files, OpenDocument, or
Microsoft Word templates created for ACL:
<https://github.com/acl-org/acl-style-files>. All papers must be
anonymous, i.e., not reveal author(s) on the title page or through
self-references. So, e.g., “We previously showed (Smith, 2020) …”,
should be avoided. Instead, use citations such as “Smith (2020)
previously showed …”.

### Review Process and Selection Criteria

Papers should describe original work; they should emphasise completed
work rather than intended work, and should indicate clearly the state
of completion of the reported results. Submissions will be judged on
correctness, originality, technical strength, significance and
relevance to the conference, and interest to the attendees.

All papers will undergo a double-blind peer review process, with final
acceptance decisions made by the workshop organisers. Authors’
workshop preferences will be considered, but final placement decisions
will be made by the organizers. Submissions that violate the
requirements above will be rejected without review.

### Presentation Format

Accepted papers will be presented as oral or poster presentations. The
mode of presentation will be determined by the workshop chairs and
does not reflect the quality of the submission.
